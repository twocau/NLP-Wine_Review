# NLP-Wine_Review

Note: data are downloaded from Kaggle.

This set of data include the description of the wine, its price, points, where it is made, what type of grapes it is made with, etc. By analyzing this set of data, we can generally categorize wine into different groups with different characters, like the aromas of the wine, the color (white or dark), sweetness, bitterness. We can further use this set of data to make an app that recommend people wine base on their preference of taste, budget, etc.
